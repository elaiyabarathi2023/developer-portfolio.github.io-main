                <h2>Waste Recycler booking Website</h2>
                <p>JunkOut is a website which makes buying and selling of waste for the consumer easy and hassle free. It connects customers with the recycler. The seller has to be a registered customer on the site to book a vendor. To book the vendor the customer will have to add their address and approximate weight of waste to sell. Vendors will have a separate login which will notify them of the bookings made for pick-up and they can contact customers. The vendors follow the rate card provided on the website.</p>
