                    I'm a full-stack developer who thrives in fast-moving environments and also a designer who loves building beautiful things with code. I am an ambitious, energetic, and enthusiastic student who loves to learn and develop skills to make myself more valuable in the workplace. I have a long-standing dream of getting into Google as an Artificial Intelligence (AI) developer. I have been learning and working with the MERN stack since 2021. I have minimal experience with the MERN stack, but I am eager to learn more and build new applications.
